# Hebrew Visions: a Hebrew Braille translation program
Ostensibly the Translator takes digital Hebrew text and translates it into Computer Braille so that it may be sent to an embosser or read on a refreshable Braille display.  A file upload interface is supported.

Running this code is produces no better output than <code>[lou_translate](http://liblouis.io/) --forward he.ctb &lt; <i>input.txt</i> &gt; <i>output.brf</i></code> does.  This legacy code is presented here for the purpose of completing the historical record.

This work is believed to have been produced for [JBI](https://jbilibrary.org) as a work-for-hire.  This belief cannot be confirmed as all parties known to have been involved in this project are long-since incommunicado.
